  <h1>Blind Typer</h1>
  <p>- Blind typer is a web tool that's used for typing down thoughts in public settings. If you've ever had an idea
    that you'd like to remember but are way too embarrased to write down in plain sight, this is a tool for you. Just
    focus your cursor into the text field and start typing, and BT will automatically start following.</p>

  <textarea id="textArea" rows="5" cols="66"></textarea>

  <div id="hidingObject">
    <button id="showButton" onclick="showText()">Reveal text</button>
    <button id="saveButton" onclick="saveContents()">Save here!</button>
  </div>

    <h1>IMPORTANT</h1>
    <p>This website doesn't have auto save, and all the data will be lost upon refreshing. Do try to backup, or to
      download what you wrote down every once in a while.</p>
